# Algorithm-Visualizer

When writing an algorithm, it is often useful to run mental simulations of the algorithm's logic in order to identify any bugs. But why should we run mental simulations when we can more easily and efficiently run them on a computer? This algorithm visualizer is an attempt to address this problem, specialized to the case of 1 and 2 dimensional arrays within Python scripts. The array and its contents are displayed graphically, as are any chosen variables which correspond to indices in the array. In total, the algorithm visualizer features:

* Tracking of an unlimited number of index variables
* Real-time mode, in which code is executed alongside the simulation
* Playback mode, in which code is executed ahead of time and the visualization is played back to the user
* Step controls for playback mode, allowing the user to navigate across individual frames
* Code editor complete with syntax highlighting
* Slider for controlling playback speed
* 'Save', 'Save As' and 'Open' functionality, which loads and stores the current configuration in a JSON file
